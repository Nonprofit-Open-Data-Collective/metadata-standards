We are trying to provide another way of categorizing 990 data using 501c types since they are organizational attributes that are defined by IRS tax law, thus placing more binding constraints on organizations. 

These groups will be used for descriptive purposes only, primarily to convert 43 different 501c types into a simpler group of 9 primary exempt purpose categories in order to make it easier to aggregate data within tables and charts: 

1. BUSINESS AND LABOR: business and labor associations
1. CHARITIES: public charities, excluding private foundations
1. CIVIC/ADVOCACY: civic engagement, advocacy, and politically engaged nonprofit organizations
1. COOPERATIVES: Wealth building and asset building organizations including credit unions.
1. INSURANCE: protection from risk (primarily services for individuals, but some offering insurance for other organizations)
1. MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS: groups that operate for the benefit of members (other than cooperatives and pensions)
1. PENSIONS: organizations designed to support wealth building, income smoothing, and specialized savings mechanisms
1. PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS: private foundations and charitable trusts
1. SPECIAL PURPOSE CORPS: tax-exempt corporations with a narrowly defined set of allowable operations


The excel file called TAX-EXEMPT-TYPES-V2.csv has one row for each 501c type and the way in which we have categorized them. 

The file called Variables.doc gives you the definitions of any abbreviations used in the spreadsheet. 

The file called PRIMARY-PURPOSE-EXAMPLES.html lists 25 nonprofits from each of the nine categories above so that you can see how the taxonomy works.
