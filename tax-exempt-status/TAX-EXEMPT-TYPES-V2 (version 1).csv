92,4947(a)(1),nonexexempt charitable trust,Nonexempt Charitable Trusts (Private Foundation),4947(a)(1) - Nonexempt Charitable Trusts (Private Foundation),"If not for Section 4947(a)(1) of the tax code, these trusts would provide a way to get most of the benefits of private foundations without having to comply with the onerous private foundation rules. Section 4947(a)(1) was enacted to prevent this. Section 4947(a)(1) applies to trusts that have two characteristics. Characteristic number one is that all of the unexpired interests must be devoted to one or more purposes described in Section 170(c)(ii)(b). That describes generally what we think of broadly as charitable purposes: religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, prevention of cruelty to animals or children. But, per the Treasury Regulations, it’s actually a bit broader than that.

Other purposes that are described in Section 170(c), for which you can get income tax deductions, can trigger section 4947 as well. That includes 170(c)(i), which is support for governmental organizations for exclusively public purposes. It also includes purposes described in 170(c)(iii), certain U.S. War Veterans Post, and 170(c)(v), certain cemetery companies. These kinds of trusts for these exclusively charitable or other tax-deductible purposes can be set up purposely during lifetime or on death, or they can arise as part of the transitional phase. For example, a 4947(a)(2) split-interest trust, like a charitable remainder trust, once the life interest ends, that becomes a 4947(a)(1) trust because, at that point, all of the unexpired interests are devoted exclusively to charitable purposes.

If a 4947(a)(1) trust will continue for some period of time, consider going ahead and filing a Form 1023 application. It’s not particularly complicated to do and, once it’s done, you eliminate the need to file a Form 1041 (if you have any taxable income) in addition to the Form 990 series return.",SOCIETY,PRIVATE FOUNDATION,NONEXEMPT CHARITABLE TRUST,NO REQ,990PF,NO,UNLIMITED,REGULAR,NOT REQ,INDEPENDENT
